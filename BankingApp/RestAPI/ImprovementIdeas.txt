1. Separate methods from AccountService into additional service of TransactionService
2. Optimize some repeating sections of a code into separate methods (e.g., in AccountService the area of CheckAccountByUserAsync)
3. Additional checking for transaction records to be made (should have a check of actual transaction accopmlishment first)
4. Create LoggingService instead of default exceptions in AccountService
